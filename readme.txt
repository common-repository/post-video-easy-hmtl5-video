A plugin for easily embedding an HTML5 video into a post/page.

== Description ==

This plugin places custom fields in the edit post or page area allowing you to fill in the fields with your mp4 mobile video url and your flv video url. You can then place the video shortcode into the content area and the video will embed automatically recognizing the device that the visitor is visiting on.

So if a iPhone visitor comes to the page, they will be able to play the mp4 video automatically and if a person on a pc visits they will see the flv video automatically.
